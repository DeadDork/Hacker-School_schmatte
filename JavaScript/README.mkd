Why I'm learning JavaScript
===========================

I feel that I need to address this question, given how much everyone disparages JS.

I am very interested in apps for iOS, Android, Google cloud apps, and Windows 8. I think that they are all incredibly fascinating technology platforms from user point of view, and I'd love to play with them.

Also, I'd love to do some website stuff.

So JavaScript is important.
